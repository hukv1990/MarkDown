1. To remove these motion blurs, conventional energy optimization based methods rely on simple assumptions such that kernel is partially uniform or locally linear. Moreover, recent machine learning based methods also depend synthetic blur datasets generated under these assumptions. This makes conventional deblurring methods fail to blurs where blur kernel is difficult to approximate or (e.g. object motion boundaries)
